# Sales_analysis_blinkit
This project analyzes historical sales data from Blinkit outlets to derive insights, detect anomalies, and predict future sales trends.
**PROJECT STRUCTURES**
**Dataset**: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis.
**Blinkit.ipynb**: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling.
**Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization.
**README.md**: Project documentation.
The key objectives are:
1.Identify sales anomalies that may indicate unusual events or operational risks.
2.Forecast future sales using ARIMA time series modeling.
**key features**
1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel/CSV formats)
2.Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA
3.Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest.
4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand data trends.
5.Feature Engineering: Creation of meaningful features to improve model performance.
6.Insights and Recommendations: Data-driven strategies to improve sales and optimize pricing.
**Tech Stack**
1.Python: pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn
